                <h2>Embracing the Low-Level: Why I'm Building for the Atari ST</h2>
            </header>

            <p>
                There's something oddly beautiful about writing code that talks directly to hardware. Lately, I've been 
                deep in the guts of an old machine, the Atari ST, building a 2D arcade game called Snake Frenzy. 
                It's a personal challenge: write performant, expressive code using C and Motorola 68k Assembly, 
                and make it fun. This kind of development strips everything down. No frameworks. No modern tooling. 
                Just me, a memory map, and a goal: get a snake to move, eat bugs, and avoid death at 70Hz. It's not 
                just retro nostalgia. It's systems thinking at its core, learning how pixels hit a screen, how interrupts 
                shape timing, and how efficiency means everything when you've got only so many cycles to work with.
                It's not easy. But it's exactly the kind of challenge that sharpens your skills, and reminds you why code matters.

                <h2>Building Websites That Actually Work (and Why That Matters)</h2>
            </header>

            <p>
                Most people think web development is about making things look good. But what I'm discovering through 
                my client projects, like the guitar tutoring and nail services sites, is that it's really about making 
                things make sense. It's semantic structure. Clear hierarchy. Predictable behavior. I've been focusing 
                on writing clean HTML, planning responsive layouts, and designing for accessibility from the start. 
                It's not flashy, but it's meaningful. Because when a site is usable, lightweight, and fast, it builds 
                trust, and that's what clients actually care about. Web dev isn't about pixel-perfect mockups. 
                It's about building tools that serve real people, with clarity and intention. That's the goal.
